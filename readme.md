# Professor Rex VonScience Saves The World

Play as a T-rex/Scientist who must fight off mammals and time travelers to gather parts to build a spaceship and blow up the asteroid that will cause the mass extinction of all dinosaurs. That seems like a reasonable thing to do with your time, right? Right.

This is the my first game and is/was being built as part of a "Thing A Week" project I'm trying, where I create a new thing every week. It's built using the [Crafty](http://craftyjs.com/) engine.
